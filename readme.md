# Steps to Use the Drag and Drop API

1. Pick an element from `container1` and start dragging it.
2. Apply the `Dragging` class to the dragged element, which will change its appearance.
3. Drag the item to `container2` and drop it there. The item will get appended to `container2`.
4. To reverse the action, repeat the same steps using elements from `container2` and appending them to `container1`.

That's it!
